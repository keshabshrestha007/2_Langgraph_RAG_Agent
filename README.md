# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Project

This project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system that combines a language model with vector database retrieval to provide more accurate and context-aware responses.  
It uses **Pinecone** as a vector store and integrates with **GROQ API** for LLM-powered reasoning.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **RAG Pipeline**: Enhances answers with retrieved knowledge from a vector database.  
- **Pinecone Integration**: Stores and retrieves embeddings efficiently.  
- **SQLite Support**: Local database (`1_multistep_rag.sqlite`) for multi-step workflows.  
- **Environment-Based Config**: API keys and configs managed via `.env`.  
- **Extensible**: Easily adaptable for different datasets and tasks.

## 🛠️ Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-project-folder>


### 2. Create a Virtual Environment
```bash

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # On Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate       # On Windows


### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

🔑 Environment Variables
Set up a .env file in the project root (already included in .gitignore for security).

Example:
    GROQ_API_KEY = "your_groq_api_key_here"
    PINECONE_API_KEY = "your_pinecone_api_key_here"
    PINECONE_ENV = "us-east-1"

▶️ Usage
Run the RAG pipeline
bash
Copy code
python main.py
Example
Input: "What are the benefits of using Pinecone with LLMs?"

Output: A context-rich answer generated by the LLM with retrieved embeddings.

⚙️ Development Notes
Temporary files, cache, and local environment are ignored via .gitignore.

SQLite database (1_multistep_rag.sqlite) supports multi-step conversation memory.

API keys must not be committed to GitHub.

📌 Future Improvements
Add support for additional vector stores (FAISS, Weaviate).

Improve multi-step reasoning with agentic workflows.

Build a simple Streamlit UI for testing queries.
